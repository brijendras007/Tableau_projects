# üìä Tableau Projects and Exercises

Welcome to the **Tableau Projects and Exercises** repository! This collection showcases a variety of Tableau assignments and projects designed to illustrate different data visualization techniques and methods. Each exercise delves into various functionalities within Tableau, providing hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization.

## üöÄ Overview

In this repository, you'll find a range of Tableau visualizations and exercises, including:

- **Basic Visualizations:** Bar charts, line graphs, and other fundamental visualizations to represent data trends and comparisons.
- **Data Source Setup:** Connecting Tableau to different data sources and configuring them for analysis.
- **Parameters:** Enhancing interactivity in dashboards with parameters that allow dynamic data views.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Creating responsive formulas that update based on user input or data changes.
- **Histograms and Binning:** Visualizing data distributions and applying binning techniques for better data grouping.
- **Heat Maps:** Using color gradients to visualize data density and patterns.
- **Tree Maps:** Displaying hierarchical data with nested rectangles to illustrate proportions.
- **Waterfall Charts:** Showing incremental changes in data to understand the flow of metrics over time.
- **Word Clouds and Bubble Charts:** Visualizing term frequency and representing data relationships.
- **Pareto Charts:** Identifying significant factors in a dataset based on the Pareto Principle.
- **Dual Axis Charts:** Comparing two metrics on the same graph for combined analysis.
